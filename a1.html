      <h2>Answers to Additional Questions</h2>
      <h3>1. Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="Graph.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>2. How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</h3>
      <p>
        The Arduino has about 13 usable pins, so in theory it could blink 13 LEDs independently. To calculate the current draw,
        we can use Ohm's Law (I = V/R). Assuming each LED has a voltage of 2V and we are using a 220-ohm resistor for each LED,
        the current through each LED would be approximately 9.09 mA (I = (5V - 2V) / 220 ohms). Therefore, for 13 LEDs, the total
        current draw would be approximately 118.17 mA.
      </p>
      <h3>3. How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</h3>
      <p>
        Setting the timer variable value to about 8 ms in the code would achieves the effect where you no longer
        tell that the LED's are blinking.
